   - **Number of Clusters**: 2-8 groups
   - **Distance Metric**: Euclidean (standard), Manhattan (robust), Cosine (pattern-based)
   - **Cluster By**: Organization, Department, or Demographic group
2. Analyze cluster characteristics
3. Design cluster-specific improvement strategies

### 3. Hierarchical Analysis (Treemap)
**Purpose**: Navigate complex organizational structures using an interactive treemap visualization
