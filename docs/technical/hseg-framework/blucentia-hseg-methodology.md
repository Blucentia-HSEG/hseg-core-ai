## Core HSEG Principles

### Human Sustainability at Scale
HSEG operates on the foundational belief that the future of work isn't just about productivity or perksâ€”it's about **human sustainability at scale**. This principle drives every aspect of the platform's design and methodology.

### Multi-Domain Universal Framework
The HSEG framework applies consistent assessment principles across four critical sectors:
- **Healthcare Systems**: Hospitals, clinics, medical practices
- **Schools & Universities**: Academic institutions at all levels
- **Enterprise Organizations**: Corporate and business environments
- **Government Agencies**: Public sector and regulatory bodies

### Five-Tier Assessment Model
All organizations are categorized using HSEG's scientifically validated tier system:

| Tier | Score Range | Classification | Intervention Level | Business Impact |
|------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| ðŸ”´ **Crisis** | 7-12 | Immediate intervention required | Executive escalation | Regulatory risk, legal liability |
| ðŸŸ  **At Risk** | 13-16 | Early warning signs present | HR intervention | Turnover risk, culture deterioration |
| âšª **Mixed** | 17-20 | Inconsistent experiences | Team-level action | Performance variability |
| ðŸ”µ **Safe** | 21-24 | Generally healthy environment | Maintenance mode | Stable operations |
| ðŸŸ¢ **Thriving** | 25-28 | Exemplary culture practices | Best practice sharing | Competitive advantage |

        # Burnout severity (1-5 scale)
        burnout_weight = self.calculate_burnout_impact(burnout_level)

        # Trauma indicators (boolean array)
        trauma_weight = self.assess_trauma_patterns(trauma_indicators)

        composite_risk = (distress_weight * 0.4 +
                         burnout_weight * 0.4 +
                         trauma_weight * 0.2)
