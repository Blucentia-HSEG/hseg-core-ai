# HSEG Comprehensive Scoring Documentation
## Five-Tier Cultural Risk Assessment Framework

---

## Executive Summary

This document establishes the comprehensive scoring methodology for the HSEG (Healthy, Safe, Equitable, Grounded) workplace culture assessment framework. The system transforms survey responses into actionable intelligence through a weighted scoring mechanism that identifies organizational risk levels across five distinct tiers.

**Framework Foundation:**
- **22 Core Questions** across 6 critical categories
- **4-Point Likert Scale** scoring (1-4, where 4 = healthiest culture)
- **Weighted Category System** with risk-proportional multipliers
- **Five-Tier Classification** (Crisis to Thriving)
- **28-Point Maximum Score** (7 minimum theoretical score)

---

## Scoring Methodology

### Core Scoring Structure

**Individual Question Scoring:**
- **4 Points**: Strongly Agree (positive statements) / Strongly Disagree (negative statements)
- **3 Points**: Agree (positive statements) / Disagree (negative statements)
- **2 Points**: Disagree (positive statements) / Agree (negative statements)
- **1 Point**: Strongly Disagree (positive statements) / Strongly Agree (negative statements)

### Category Weights and Risk Classification

| Category | Questions | Weight | Risk Level | Max Points |
|----------|-----------|---------|------------|------------|
| **Power Abuse & Suppression** | 4 | 3.0 (Critical) | Highest | 12 |
| **Failure of Accountability** | 4 | 3.0 (Critical) | Highest | 12 |
| **Discrimination & Exclusion** | 3 | 2.5 (Severe) | High | 7.5 |
| **Mental Health Harm** | 4 | 2.5 (Severe) | High | 10 |
| **Manipulative Work Culture** | 3 | 2.0 (Moderate) | Medium | 6 |
| **Erosion of Voice & Autonomy** | 4 | 2.0 (Moderate) | Medium | 8 |
| **Total** | **22** | - | - | **55.5** |

### Weighted Score Calculation

**Step 1: Category Score Calculation**
```
Category Score = (Sum of Question Scores Ã· Number of Questions) Ã— Category Weight
```

**Step 2: Total Weighted Score**
```
Total Score = Sum of All Category Scores
Maximum Possible = 55.5 points
Minimum Possible = 13.875 points
```

**Step 3: Normalization to 28-Point Scale**
```
Normalized Score = (Total Weighted Score Ã· 55.5) Ã— 28
Rounded to nearest integer for tier classification
```

- Students/employees may not feel safe speaking up
- Action now can prevent escalation
- **Preventive Intervention Needed**

**Risk Indicators:**
- Warning signs across multiple categories

## Statistical Analysis Framework

### Central Tendency Measures

**Maximum Possible Score:** 28 points
- Achieved when all 22 questions receive maximum scores
- Weighted calculation: 55.5 Ã· 55.5 Ã— 28 = 28

**Minimum Possible Score:** 7 points
- Theoretical minimum if all questions receive lowest scores
- Weighted calculation: 13.875 Ã· 55.5 Ã— 28 = 7

**Expected Average Score:** 17.5 points (Mixed tier)
- Assumes normal distribution of responses
- Represents neutral organizational culture

**Critical Thresholds:**
- **Below 13**: Crisis intervention required
- **13-16**: Early warning system activation
- **17-20**: Targeted improvement initiatives
- **21-24**: Excellence maintenance programs
- **25+**: Best practice documentation and sharing

### Demographic and Organizational Analysis
