## 📊 Survey Methodology & Implementation

### Survey Structure (Target: 4-5 minutes)
- **Core Assessment**: 18-22 questions across 6 categories
- **Demographics**: 6-8 questions
- **Open Response**: 1 optional qualitative question
- **Total Items**: 25-30 maximum

### Response Format Standardization
- **Likert Scales**: Consistent 4-point format (eliminates neutral response bias)
- **Frequency Scales**: 4-point temporal (Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Often)
- **Severity Scales**: 5-point intensity where clinically relevant

### Indirect Measurement Techniques
1. **Third-Person Framing**: "People here feel..." vs "I feel..."
2. **Scenario-Based Questions**: Present situations, ask for likelihood ratings
3. **Behavioral Frequency**: Focus on observable behaviors vs attitudes
4. **Reverse Coding**: Mix positive/negative framings to prevent response bias

### Quality Assurance Measures
- **Attention Checks**: 1-2 embedded validity questions
- **Response Time Monitoring**: Flag unusually fast completions
- **Pattern Detection**: Identify straight-line responding
- **Qualitative Validation**: Cross-reference with open response themes

## 🔍 Analytical Framework

### Scoring Methodology
- **Weighted Aggregation**: Apply category weights (Critical=3.0, Severe=2.5, Moderate=2.0)
- **Standardization**: Convert all scales to 4-point equivalents
- **Reliability Monitoring**: Calculate Cronbach's α for each category per assessment
- **Demographic Stratification**: Analyze scores by key demographic intersections

### Red Flag Detection Algorithms
- **Individual Item Thresholds**: Flag responses indicating severe issues
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify combinations suggesting systematic problems
- **Demographic Disparities**: Detect differential experiences by group
- **Trend Analysis**: Monitor changes over time and across assessments

### Validation Checks
- **Convergent Validity**: Correlation with established measures where available
- **Discriminant Validity**: Differentiation between known good/poor cultures
- **Predictive Validity**: Correlation with outcome measures (turnover, engagement)
- **Cross-Cultural Validity**: Performance across diverse populations
