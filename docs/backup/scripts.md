## üß† AI Prompt Engineering System

### Theoretical Foundation

The AI narrative generation system is based on advanced prompt engineering principles designed to create human-like trauma responses that reflect authentic psychological patterns.

### Prompt Engineering Architecture

#### 1. **Contextual Prompt Construction**
```python
prompt_context = {
    "company": company_name,
    "culture_phrase": company_specific_culture,
    "demographics": {age, gender, position, tenure},
    "trauma_type": domain_specific_trauma,
    "psychological_state": risk_tier_mapping
}
```

#### 2. **Domain-Specific Trauma Modeling**

**Healthcare Trauma Types**:
- Patient death trauma with guilt and PTSD symptoms
- Medical error incidents leading to professional crisis
- COVID-19 overwhelm with systematic breakdown
- Violence from patients/families with safety fears
- Moral injury from resource scarcity decisions

**University Trauma Types**:
- Advisor psychological abuse with power dynamics
- Sexual harassment with career retaliation threats
- Research theft and intellectual property violation
- Academic bullying with systematic humiliation
- Financial exploitation with poverty-level wages

**Business Trauma Types**:
- Manager verbal abuse with systematic degradation
- Workplace harassment with HR protection failures
- Discrimination with promotion and recognition bias
- Layoff trauma with financial security destruction
- Performance gaslighting with reality distortion

#### 3. **Psychological Authenticity Framework**

**Trauma Symptom Integration**:
- **PTSD Manifestations**: Flashbacks, hypervigilance, avoidance patterns
- **Anxiety Disorders**: Panic attacks, physical symptoms, workplace phobias
- **Depression Patterns**: Hopelessness, self-worth destruction, isolation
- **Coping Mechanisms**: Alcohol use, therapy seeking, support group participation

**Expression Pattern Modeling**:
- **Emotional Progression**: Shock ‚Üí Anger ‚Üí Despair ‚Üí Help-seeking/Isolation
- **Vulnerability Markers**: Admitting weakness, seeking validation, expressing shame
- **Authentic Details**: Time markers, physical symptoms, specific locations

#### 4. **Narrative Generation Process**

**Step 1: Risk Tier Assessment**
```python
if risk_tier == "Crisis":
    template_category = "severe_trauma_prompts"
    symptom_severity = "clinical_ptsd_depression"
    narrative_length = "600-800_characters"
elif risk_tier == "At_Risk":
    template_category = "moderate_trauma_prompts"
    symptom_severity = "anxiety_burnout"
    narrative_length = "400-600_characters"
```

**Step 2: Company Culture Integration**
```python
culture_phrase = random.choice(company_data["cultural_phrases"])
stress_factors = company_data["stress_factors"]
specific_incident = generate_domain_incident(domain, stress_factors)
```

**Step 3: Prompt Template Selection**
```python
prompt_template = select_template(
    domain=domain,
    risk_tier=risk_tier,
    question_type=question_type
)
```

**Step 4: Context-Aware Generation**
```python
narrative = prompt_template.format(
    company=company,
    culture_phrase=culture_phrase,
    demographics=demographics,
    trauma_incident=specific_incident,
    psychological_symptoms=selected_symptoms
)
```

### Human-Like Response Characteristics

- "Haven't slept properly in months - flashbacks every night"
- "Panic attacks triggered by hospital sounds"
- "EMDR therapy for trauma from violent patient attacks"
- "Considering leaving medicine despite student loans"

**Psychological Terminology Integration**:
- Clinical terms used naturally: "PTSD", "panic disorder", "hypervigilance"
- Symptom descriptions: "intrusive thoughts", "emotional numbing", "dissociation"
- Treatment references: "trauma-informed therapy", "EMDR", "exposure therapy"

**Workplace Specificity**:
- Domain-specific incidents: "code blue alarms", "dissertation defense", "performance review"
- Company culture references: "HMO model pressures", "publish or perish", "keeper test"
- Organizational context: "Title IX process", "HR protection", "employee assistance program"

#### Emotional Authenticity Markers

**Vulnerability Expression**:
- "I hate admitting this, but..."
- "It's embarrassing to say..."
- "I feel like a failure for..."
- "Everyone else seems to handle..."

**Temporal Progression**:
- "At first I thought it was just..."
- "Initially I couldn't believe..."
- "Now I realize what really happened was..."
- "Looking back, I was in complete denial..."

**Physical Manifestation Details**:
- "my hands were shaking"
- "couldn't catch my breath"
- "heart was racing"
- "felt like throwing up"
