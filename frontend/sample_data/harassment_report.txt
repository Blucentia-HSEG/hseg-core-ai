Employee Incident Report - Workplace Harassment

My supervisor has been making inappropriate comments about my appearance and personal life for the past three months. When I asked him to stop, he started assigning me impossible deadlines and excluding me from important meetings.

The hostile work environment has caused me severe anxiety and I'm having trouble sleeping. I've requested a transfer but HR keeps delaying their response. Several colleagues have witnessed the inappropriate behavior but are afraid to speak up due to fear of retaliation.

This situation is affecting my mental health significantly and I'm considering seeking legal counsel if the company doesn't take immediate action.
