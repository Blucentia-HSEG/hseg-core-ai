Confidential Employee Support Request

I'm writing to request immediate assistance with a mental health crisis I'm experiencing due to workplace conditions. The constant pressure, unrealistic deadlines, and lack of support from management have pushed me to my breaking point.

I've been having panic attacks at work and thoughts of self-harm. The toxic work culture where mistakes are met with public humiliation rather than constructive feedback has destroyed my confidence and self-worth.

I desperately need help but I'm afraid of being labeled as weak or having it affect my job security. The stress has spilled over into my personal life, affecting my relationships and sleep. I'm at the point where I'm considering whether life is worth living if this is what work has to be like.
